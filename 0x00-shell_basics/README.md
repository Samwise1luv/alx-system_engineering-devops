the first script prints the absolute path name of the current working directory
the second changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.
the third  creates a directory named 'my_first_directory' in the /tmp/ directory
the fourth script  changes the working directory to the previous one.
the fifth  lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.
the sixth prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.
